# Testing the certificates for server and client

This sub-folder contains two tests when the generated certificates can be used.

1. Use for server (including cert chain) to expose its trusted cert
2. Use for client to verify the server

In programming languages:

- `Python`: both server and client
- `Java`: just client (use python server if needed)
